    <h1 id="gears">GEARS</h1>
   <pre>  .A gear is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth or, in the case of a cogwheel or gearwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another (compatible) toothed part to transmit rotational power. While doing so, they can change the torque and rotational speed being transmitted (in inverse proportion) and also change the rotational axis of the power being transmitted. The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape.[1]

    The basic principle behind the operation of gears is analogous to the basic principle of levers.[2] Meshing gears of different diameters produce three changes â€” (i) a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, (ii) an inverse change in rotational speed and (iii) a change in the sense of the rotation, a clockwise rotation becoming an anti-clockwise one and vice-versa</pre>
